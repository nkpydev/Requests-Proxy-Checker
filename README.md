# Requests Proxy Checker

Proxies are integral part of any webactivity now-a-days.

Any number of proxies that we have, we need to know the working status, of them.. specifically some proxies won't work on some specific URLs, we need to know which ones are working on which and not on which...

So, I created this program, which has following features:
- [x] Uses Requests
- [x] Has feature to check on specific URLs
- [x] Can work with authenticated as well as non-authenticated proxies
- [x] Easily modifiable
- [x] **Takes input into a input.txt file and generate output of result.csv**

## To Do:
- ~~Write result into a CSV file~~
